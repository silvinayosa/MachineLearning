## 📁 Project Descriptions

### 🔹 `wine-prediction/`

A machine learning app that predicts wine quality based on chemical properties. It includes:

- EDA (correlation matrix, bar charts)
- Multiple ML models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- Interactive **Streamlit** interface for model comparison and custom predictions

▶️ To run the app:

```bash
cd wine-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run wine_prediction.py
🔹 glass-classifier/
A classification analysis of glass types using the glass.csv dataset.

Full EDA: bar charts, histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation heatmap

Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors

Final model saved using joblib for reuse

🧠 Goals
✅ Practice data preprocessing, visualization, and model training
✅ Compare classifier performance in simple datasets
✅ Build interactive demos using Streamlit
✅ Keep code clean, modular, and reproducible

🔧 Tools Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Streamlit

Joblib
